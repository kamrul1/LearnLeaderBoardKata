# Leader Board Kata

This is my personal attempt to do the [Leader Board Kata](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/main/katas/Leaderboard.md)

Initial thoughts, I've seen/attempted this Kara previously but can't find the source for it.

# Setup

PlayerRank class - position, name, score
Player class - name, score

# PlayerRank 
Test that the basic behavior is correct when there are no duplicate scores.
